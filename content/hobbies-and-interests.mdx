When I'm not coding, I immerse myself in the world of mangas, manhuas, and anime. Thereâ€™s something incredibly captivating about the storytelling and artwork in these mediums. Some of my favorite series include One Piece and hunter X Hunter. I love diving into new stories and exploring different genres.

Apart from that, I'm an avid gamer. Video games provide a great way to unwind and challenge myself in different ways. Whether it's exploring vast open worlds, engaging in strategic battles, or just having fun with friends, gaming is a big part of my life.
