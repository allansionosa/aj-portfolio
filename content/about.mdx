Hi my name is Allan, a front-end web developer with a keen interest in creating websites from scratch, ensuring they are not only functional but also user-friendly and visually appealing. My professional journey involves designing in Figma, creating prototypes, and developing both the frontend and backend of websites, particularly for hospital clients.
